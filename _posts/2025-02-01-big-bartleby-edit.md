Up until now this has been a process of growth and exploration, the messy side of the Newman design process. This month started with Bartleby's built in speakers, and ended with a completely different enclosure design. The guts changed so the box changed. Candide is sounding nice if a bit laggy. I should probably buy a big 3d printer.
