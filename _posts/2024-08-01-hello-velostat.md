So if you put carbon dust in goo you get kinda conductive material that becomes more conductive when deformed as it presses the carbon dust closer together. Pressure sensitivity. Thats fun. I used a conductive ink pen to lay down some traces and made a paper craft pressure pad that detects both Z and X pressure. I made an instagram and called it Attach Part.
