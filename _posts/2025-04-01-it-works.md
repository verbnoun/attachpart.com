I never printed a Benchy or whatever that boat is called. I just printed my models every which way I could figure, every support configuration, all PETG. Finally I've got some prints that have utility, look good enough, and all fit together. This month I also designed a spring for order. I had to build a spring tester, good thing I have a 3d printer. I went with 2 color ways: light mode and dark mode.
