Back at the lab I started with two issues, speed and bend. Too much lag and slow pairing time has led me to validate a C++ migration, it works, this is the way. Per key pitch bend required a fundamental pressure switch layout change on the PCB, I took this time to design 4 different switch pads and stagger the switches so the bend fulcrum is under the middle of each key. Designed and PCB ordered
